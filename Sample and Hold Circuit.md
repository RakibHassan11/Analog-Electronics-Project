## ðŸ“¥ Sample and Hold Circuit â€“ Analog Signal Processing Project

This is a breadboard implementation of a **Sample and Hold (S&H)** circuit, built as part of an undergraduate project for an Analog Signal Processing course. The circuit captures (samples) an analog input voltage at regular intervals and holds that value for a certain period before updating again.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To demonstrate the fundamental operation of a Sample and Hold system used in analog-to-digital interfaces, data acquisition systems, and signal timing applications.

### ðŸ”§ Features
- Captures and stores analog voltage based on a control (clock) signal
- Holds the sampled voltage steady until the next trigger
- LED indicators for timing/debugging
- Multiple input controls for testing with varying signal levels

### ðŸ§© Key Components
- Operational amplifier (e.g., LM324)
- Capacitor (for holding voltage)
- Analog switch or transistor (for sampling control)
- Resistors, potentiometers, and timing circuitry
- LEDs for visual feedback

### ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how analog signals are held for ADC sampling
- Circuit behavior during signal transitions and hold states
- Timing control using discrete components
- Practical prototyping using breadboards

> ðŸ§ª This project illustrates a core concept in analog-to-digital signal interfacing and timing control in mixed-signal systems.
