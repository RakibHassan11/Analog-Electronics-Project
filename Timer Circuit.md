## ⏱️ Timer Circuit using NE555 – Analog Electronics Project

This is a timer circuit built using the **NE555 Timer IC** as part of an undergraduate project for the **Analog Electronics** course in the ECE curriculum. The circuit operates in either **monostable** or **astable** mode, depending on the configuration, and demonstrates basic timing and pulse generation principles.

### 🔧 Features
- Based on NE555 Timer IC
- Configurable for monostable (single pulse) or astable (continuous pulse) operation
- Time interval controlled by RC (resistor-capacitor) network
- LED output for visual indication
- Breadboard prototype for testing and demonstration

### 🧩 Components Used
- NE555 Timer IC
- Resistors, capacitors (for timing)
- LED and limiting resistor
- Power supply (5V or 12V)

### 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding NE555 timer functionality
- Working with RC time constants
- Timing-based signal generation
- Real-world applications like delay circuits and blinkers

> ✅ A fundamental analog project to explore timing behavior and waveform control using the classic NE555 IC.
