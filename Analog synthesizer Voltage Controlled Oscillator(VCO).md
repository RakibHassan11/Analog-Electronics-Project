## 🎛️ Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) for Analog Synthesizer

This project is a custom-built **voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)** for an analog synthesizer, developed as part of an electronics prototyping exercise. It allows precise control of voltage signals using multiple potentiometers, enabling manual modulation of analog synth parameters like pitch, filter cutoff, and LFO rates.

### 🔧 Features
- Multi-channel voltage output via precision potentiometers
- Designed for use with analog synthesizer modules
- Built on a breadboard for modular testing and flexibility
- LED indicators for real-time voltage activity
- Fine-tuning trim pots for calibration

### 🧩 Components Used
- Multiple potentiometers (control knobs)
- Operational amplifiers (LM324)
- Resistors, capacitors for signal conditioning
- LEDs and transistors for visual feedback
- Trimpots for precise voltage scaling

### 📷 Hardware Overview
- Each knob outputs a variable voltage (typically 0–5V or 0–12V)
- Outputs can be connected to VCOs, VCFs, VCAs, or other CV inputs on analog synths
- LEDs provide visual indication of active control voltage paths

> 🔌 Designed for modular synth prototyping, testing CV ranges, and manual sound shaping.
