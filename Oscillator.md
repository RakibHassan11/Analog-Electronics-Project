## 🎚️ Oscillator – Sine Wave Generator

This is a basic analog sine wave oscillator circuit built on a breadboard. It uses an op-amp (LM324) along with capacitors and resistors to generate a continuous sine wave output.

### 🔧 Features
- Generates a clean sine wave
- Built using standard analog components
- Useful for signal generation and testing

### 🔍 Components
- LM324 Op-Amp
- Timing capacitors & resistors
- Potentiometer for tuning
